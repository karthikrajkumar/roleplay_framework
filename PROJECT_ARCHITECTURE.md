# AI Roleplay Platform - Modular Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive architecture design for our advanced AI roleplay platform, implementing microservices patterns with strict adherence to SOLID principles and enterprise-grade scalability.

## Architecture Principles

### SOLID Principles Implementation
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service and module has one well-defined purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Services are open for extension, closed for modification through interfaces
- **Liskov Substitution**: All implementations are replaceable through common interfaces
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on interfaces they use
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Microservices Design Patterns
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Services organized around business capabilities
- **API-First Design**: All services expose well-defined APIs
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication via events
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation for complex operations
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management

## Service Architecture Patterns

### 1. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
Each service follows hexagonal architecture with:
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic and entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External adapters (DB, APIs, etc.)
- **Interfaces**: Ports for dependency inversion

### 2. Clean Architecture Layers
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         Presentation Layer      │ ← Controllers, GraphQL resolvers
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│         Application Layer       │ ← Use cases, application services
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│         Domain Layer            │ ← Entities, domain services, interfaces
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│         Infrastructure Layer    │ ← Repositories, external services
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Backend Services
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ with TypeScript for type safety
- **Framework**: Fastify for high-performance APIs
- **Communication**: gRPC for inter-service, GraphQL for client-facing
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **Database**: MongoDB (primary), PostgreSQL (transactional), Redis (cache)

### Frontend Applications
- **Web**: React 18 with Next.js 14 for SSR/SSG
- **Mobile**: React Native with Expo for cross-platform development
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight state management
- **UI Components**: Custom design system with Radix UI primitives

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with Helm charts
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for traffic management and security
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger for observability

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Pyramid
- **Unit Tests**: 70% coverage minimum
- **Integration Tests**: API and database integration
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user journeys
- **Contract Tests**: Service interface validation

### Code Quality
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code formatting and linting
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security scanning
- **Husky**: Git hooks for quality gates
- **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit messages

## Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Model
- **mTLS**: Service-to-service encryption
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control
- **JWT**: Stateless authentication with refresh tokens
- **OWASP**: Security best practices implementation

### Compliance Framework
- **GDPR**: Data privacy and user consent management
- **SOC 2**: Security controls and audit compliance
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

## Deployment Strategy

### Multi-Environment Pipeline
- **Development**: Feature branches with ephemeral environments
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Production**: Blue-green deployment with canary releases

### GitOps Workflow
- **ArgoCD**: Declarative deployment management
- **Flux**: GitOps for infrastructure automation
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes HPA and VPA
- **Load Balancing**: Application and database load balancing
- **Caching**: Multi-level caching strategy
- **CDN**: Global content distribution

### Performance Optimization
- **Database**: Connection pooling, read replicas, sharding
- **API**: Response caching, pagination, field selection
- **Frontend**: Code splitting, lazy loading, service workers
- **AI Models**: Edge deployment, model quantization

## Monitoring and Observability

### Three Pillars of Observability
- **Metrics**: Business and system metrics with Prometheus
- **Logs**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Traces**: Distributed tracing with Jaeger

### SLI/SLO Framework
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime target
- **Latency**: P95 < 100ms response time
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% for critical operations
- **Throughput**: Auto-scaling based on demand

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **GitFlow**: Feature branches with protected main/develop
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automated version management
- **Pull Requests**: Code review and automated testing

### Developer Experience
- **Hot Reload**: Local development with hot reloading
- **Docker Compose**: Local multi-service development
- **VSCode Extensions**: Consistent development environment
- **Documentation**: Living documentation with examples

This architecture ensures our platform exceeds current market solutions while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability, security, and scalability.
