"""
Distributed Systems Architecture for Massive Scalability

This module provides breakthrough distributed systems components designed to surpass
current roleplay platforms with advanced algorithms for consensus, caching, load balancing,
replication, and fault tolerance.

Key Features:
- Advanced consensus protocols for global AI state synchronization
- Multi-layer intelligent distributed caching with Redis clusters
- ML-powered predictive load balancing algorithms
- Geo-distributed replication with conflict resolution
- Proactive failure detection and auto-recovery systems
- Dynamic resource allocation and optimization
- Adaptive network routing and bandwidth management
- Multi-user scenario coordination protocols
- Intelligent data partitioning and sharding strategies
- Real-time performance monitoring and optimization

Designed for:
- 100k+ concurrent users globally
- Sub-100ms latency for real-time interactions
- 99.99% uptime with automatic failover
- Horizontal scaling across multiple regions
